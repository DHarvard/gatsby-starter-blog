There is a lot of misunderstanding and confusion when it comes to images in web design. The biggest 
misunderstanding is that many think that having the image at its highest quality is the best way but 
the problem with that is that the file size typically increases as the quality increases.

### Image Types

There are two types of images, which are **raster** and **vector**. Both of these types of images have their own 
advantages and uses. In a simple explanation, raster images use pixels, dots, to create an image while 
vector images use polygons, line segments that connect verticesâ€™s together. Both image types will be used
at different times in web design and they should be used appropriately.

### File Types

The most commonly used file types in web design are JPEG, PNG, and GIF images.

### Compression Types

There are two types of compression being lossy compression and lossless compression. In simple terms, when 
lossless compression is used there is no data lost but it is preserved while when lossy compression is used
some data is lost.
