My name is Darrin Harvard. I am excited to get going with my new blog and I hope you will enjoy following me on my adventures.

I am 28 years old, studying web development at UVU. I am currently learning how to use gatsby with this starter blog repoistory. 
 
[Legends of Runeterra](https://playruneterra.com/en-us/) is a game I have really enjoyed playing in my down time recently.

> that the game has is that their are champions that can level up if they achieve
> their goal.

Below is an example of one of the cards.
