I started to go rock climbing towards the beginning of 2019. I started to go with a couple of my friends
to The Quarry, an indoors climbing facility in Provo, UT.

After a few weeks, I decided to get my own climbing pass there at The Quarry which gives me access to use the facility
how ever often I would like, I get one free buddy pass a month in which I can get a buddy in for free at that time, and
then every Friday is guest day, which every member gets a free buddy pass as well for Fridays.


There are many reasons why you should get into rock climbing. I like it because it is a great workout while also being
a social sport. You should check out this great article.
